## Find nearest data center by provider
This app shows list of the nearest data centers for a selected provider.
If Geo position of  a user is not available it would show list of all data centers for a selected provider.

### Demo


### How to run
To run app locally you need to run:

```sh
yarn start
``` 

### Further improvements
Would need to add reasonable test and make it prettier.
